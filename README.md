# SQL-Challenge
*It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.*


*Skills and technique shown in this challenge:

-Define SQL data types, primary keys, and unique values.

-Load the data from CSV files into a database and then query the data.

-Combine the data from multiple tables by using JOIN clauses.

-Apply data modeling techniques to database design.

-Identify data relationships.

-Create visual representations of a database by using ERDs.

Resources that I used to complete this assignment is classroom material, going over class activities and recorded class videos. I also used Stack overflow and learning assistant to complete my assignment.
